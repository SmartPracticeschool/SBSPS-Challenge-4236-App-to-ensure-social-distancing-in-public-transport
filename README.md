# SBSPS-Challenge-4236-App-to-ensure-social-distancing-in-public-transport
Our project is an intelligent app that helps to ensure safety while using public transport.
We all know about the COVID-19 outbreak. So this is the time that we have to be very careful. Small mistakes can lead to community spreads.
That can cause problems that can't be controlled. 
Even if we ourselves decide to be careful, it alone can't benefit. Because this has to be done together.
We all know that the most important thing that we must ensure is to wear masks.
While using public transport, we need to be very careful.
This app helps you to prebook your ticket prior to using public transport.
You can book the ticket only if you are wearing the mask.
On opening the app, your webcam turns on, captures your picture, detects whether you are wearing a mask and enables you to book the ticket only if you are wearing the mask.
We can extend the functionality of this app by adding a count of the maximum number of people who can travel in a bus or any other public transports and people won't be able to book the ticket if this count has reached.
